# Programming Haskell doesn't require any category theory

There seems to be a common misconception among some people new to Haskell that
programming Haskell requires you to learn category theory first. Nothing could
be further from the truth. Category theory is a beautifully abstract field of
mathematics, but is *not at all* a requirement when you want to learn Haskell
or build serious software with it.

I don't have any formal background in mathematics, don't know anything about
category theory. I struggle a lot in reading formally writings, and I have
never really understood those fancy categorical diagrams. Still, I write
real-life Haskell code on a daily basis [for a living](http://www.silkapp.com).
I use __monads__ / __arrows__ / __applicatives__ / __functors__ / __lenses__ /
__categories__ / __monoids__ all the time and love them. Not because I
understand their theoretical foundation, but because they help me solve my
day-to-day problems.

So, my advice to anyone eager to learn Haskell: please put away your category
theory books and just start to write code, *write a lot of code*. Continuously
think about what your code means and how it could be improved, you'll quickly
pick up on Haskell's fancy abstractions yourself.

Haskell is a fantastic general purpose programming language that people use to
write all kinds of software. Do you want to build web applications,
[client](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fay) or
[server](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/snap)? Desktop applications using
[graphical users interfaces](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gtk)? [3D game
engines](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lambdacube-engine) using OpenGL?
[Build scripts](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake) to replace your
Makefiles? All is possible. In Haskell you can have the performance of C and the
abstraction of Prolog, it is very versatile.

The idea that is Haskell is mostly suited for a more mathematical style of
programming is simply wrong.
