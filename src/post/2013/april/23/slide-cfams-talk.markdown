# Slides of my talk at CFAMS

Last night I gave a talk at the <a href=http://www.meetup.com/funadam/>Cross
Functional Amsterdam</a> user group. The audience was very enthusiastic and
provided some thought provoking feedback. Thanks everyone for attending and
thanks TTY for organizing!

As promised I've put the slides online. The slides were build with HTML/CSS and
don't render correctly in all browsers, so I put some effort into exporting
them to PDF. Some of the margins in the PDF ended up a bit weird, but they're
quite readable after all.

If you want to learn more about Haskell, [Learn You a Haskell for Great
Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) might be a good place to start.
