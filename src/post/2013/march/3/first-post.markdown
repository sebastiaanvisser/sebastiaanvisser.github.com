# First post!

It's time for a website! I decided I needed a place online were I can put my
ideas, projects and proof of concepts online. This blog is the result.

The site is fully static and hosted on [github](http://github.com).
I used [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) to generate the HTML and
[Clay](http://fvisser.nl/clay) to generate the CSS stylesheets.
If interested, you can find the source of this site [on my
github](https://github.com/sebastiaanvisser/sebastiaanvisser.github.com).
