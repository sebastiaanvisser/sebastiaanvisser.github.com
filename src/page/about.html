  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Sebastiaan Visser. I'm one of the engineers behind <a
  href=http://silkapp.com>Silk</a>, a tool that brings the semantic web to the
  masses. In my spare time I'm involved in some open source software projects
  as well, mainly written in Haskell and JavaScript. Besides software I
  interested in design, typography, illustrating, 3D-modeling and running.</p>
  <p>I live in Utrecht and work in Amsterdam, beautiful cities that I both very
  much enjoy. If you want to contact me, you can do so by mail (sebastiaan at
  this domain) or twitter (<a href=http://twitter.com/sfvisser>@sfvisser</a>).</p>
