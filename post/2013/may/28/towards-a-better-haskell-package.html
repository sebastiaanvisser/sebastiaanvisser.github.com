<h1 id="towards-a-better-haskell-package">Towards a better Haskell package</h1>
<p>Hackage, the package repository for the <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming language, has around 5000 package nowadays. This is a lot! More libraries for a programming language can generally be considered a good thing. But like everyone knows, package quality varies a lot and not all are easy to work with. There are some general guidelines that can make a package more user friendly: focus the public interface and documentation on <em>usage</em> not implementation, keep code simple and don’t over-engineer, be careful with chances between versions, etc.</p>
<p>I would like to share set of guidelines I use myself in an attempt to make my own Haskell package easier to work with.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-clear-module-structure">Have a clear module structure</h2>
<p>From a usability perspective the module structure of a package matters a lot. Modules are the top level building blocks of a library and tell a lot about what is has to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Keep the module hierarchy flat.</em> Deeply nested hierarchies might be correct from a theoretical point of view, but don’t necessarily benefit the user. Shallow hierarchies are easier to grasp and bring focus to the modules that are important.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use a short top-level namespace.</em> There is no need for long module prefixes when a creatively chosen package name suffices. A quick <code>import Parsec</code> is more convenient than <code>import   Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec</code>. Top level namespaces like <code>Control</code>, <code>Data</code>, and <code>Text</code> rarely add anything.</p></li>
<li><p><em>One import, batteries included.</em> Have one top-level module that exposes the biggest sane default of the library as possible. Requiring users to import several modules to get even the most basic functionality is inconvenient. A common trick is directly export the most important functions through the top-level module and expose everything else using module re-exports.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="document-package-usage">Document package usage</h2>
<p>Good documentation is a no-brainer upon which everyone agrees. Writing proper documentation takes a lot of work though. Maybe more than we can expect of every open-source volunteer and hobbyist. There are some ways to make a small amount of documentation matter. When a user finds out how to use the package on a high-level, they’ll figure out the details out themselves eventually.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Focus documentation on usage, not implementation.</em> Focus on the main use case, don’t go into detail about the billion ways a generic functions can be configured to work under all circumstances. The actual implementation of a library is hardly useful to users that doesn’t even know how to use the API.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Think about the generated documentation.</em> The <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a> documentation of a package is probably the first thing users see. Make sure there is some structure in there, similar functions grouped together, types first, use section headers. Add some documentation that explains what the functions and datatypes have to offer, not how they are implemented.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Be honest about the shortcomings.</em> Users will figure them out anyways. Clearly documenting things that don’t work as expected can save people a lot of time.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Create a website with a tutorial.</em> Documentation within the package is good for reference purposes, but is rarely a good starting point. Just a few steps to get up and running is good enough most of the time. Haskell code can be abstract and vague some times, concrete examples help.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keep-the-code-simple">Keep the code simple</h2>
<p>Haskell beginners often claim Haskell is a complicated language, requiring a big change in the way they think about programming. As if a paradigm shift isn’t hard enough already, some Haskell packages present their code and their API in a more complicated way than necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Keep type signatures simple.</em> Complicated type signatures are hard to grasp, not only for beginners. Haskell allows for some really generic code and additional type parameters sneak in easy. Keep the package internals general, but expose sane defaults for a first time user.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Avoid type classes.</em> Type classes are wonderful technology but are by far the easiest way to obscure a library. Avoid them whenever possible. Sometimes it’s better to provide a few concrete helper functions to deal with different types in an API, than to introduce to a type class to abstract them away. Don’t hide complexity behind magic.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Avoid useless identifier prefixes.</em> Code for qualified imports. Too much two and three letter prefixes makes code cryptic and less appealing. Use simple and short identifiers that make sense in the context of the package. Don’t be afraid for names clashes with the Prelude or other packages, explicit imports and qualified import solve this problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keep-the-package-stable">Keep the package stable</h2>
<p>Chances are a package isn’t perfect, especially the first few releases. Be clear about what it does and what it doesn’t. Assume people are actually using the package and changes to it <a href="http://xkcd.com/1172">will break their workflow</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Stick to the Package Versioning Policy.</em> The PVP allows developers to keep their stack stable and avoid broken builds. Sneaking breaking changes into a minor bump will most likely result in some red dots on a build server somewhere. Although it can be useful to ignore version upper bounds when developing, removing this precious information from the version number would be a shame. Instructing our build tools build to ignore upper bounds might be a better solution than skipping them altogether.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Prune the dependencies.</em> More dependencies make packages harder to install and easier to break. Don’t depend on entire stacks of extra dependencies just for a few simple helper functions. Avoid reinventing the wheel, but be pragmatic.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Don’t hide big impact chances behind minor bumps.</em> Some changes are major but don’t change the API, be careful with those. Silently changing a network request timeout to a tenth of it’s original value in a minor upgrade might break the user’s network stack. Fixing an encoding bug that has been the package for years? Chances are someone assumed this was intended and now has a double encoding bug. Be explicit.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Have a changelog.</em> Seeing what has changed between version is invaluable information. Both in what the new version can add in value, and what it might break. Digging through git logs before an upgrade is dreadful.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="encourage-collaboration">Encourage collaboration</h2>
<p>Packages are never finished, the more people work on it the faster it will improve. There are some tricks to simplify collaboration.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Expose internals.</em> Export them either in a separate package or in a namespace separate from the public API. Forking remains expensive. Avoiding a fork by allowing a <code>Binary</code> instance for the otherwise opaque data constructor through an internals module can save a lot time.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Think about licensing.</em> The reusability of a package depends greatly on the type of license used. Everyone has their own opinion about open source software and a variety of licenses are available. At least give it a thought and don’t just pick one.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Host on Github.</em> Github makes forking and pushing changes upstream extremely easy. Forking a package, fixing a bug, requesting a merge back, and a new deploy to Hackage can all be done in a matter of hours. Don’t like Github? Use one of their competitors. Self hosting rarely benefits collaboration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The points on my list mostly arrive from my experience with existing Haskell libraries, most of which very high quality. I would be lying if I claimed my own packages conform to this list entirely. Luckily packages can be developed and updated incrementally while knowledge and insight changes.</p>
<p>After seeing my share of real world Haskell I’m very much impressed by the quality of libraries, but we should never stop thinking about how we can improve.</p>
<hr>

<p>Disagree or do you have things that should be added to the list? Let me know!</p>
