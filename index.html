      <p>As some of you know I'm the author of <code>fclabels</code>, that
      other lens library that isn't <code>lens</code>. I recently released a
      new version and I'm very happy with result. But I knew beforehand that
      usage would probably be extremely low. Mainly because of the popularity
      of the <code>lens</code> library... <span class="read-more"><a href="./post/2013/okt/11/why-i-dont-like-the-lens-library.html">(more)</a></span> </p> </li>

      </p>
      <p>I'm excited to announce a brand new major version of
      <code>fclabels</code>. This Haskell library provides first class labels
      that can act as bidirectional record fields. The labels can be derived
      automatically using Template Haskell which means you don't have to write
      any boilerplate yourself. The labels are implemented as lenses and are
      fully composable. Lenses can be used to get, set and modify parts of a
      data type in a consistent
      way... <span class="read-more"><a href="./post/2013/okt/1/fclabels-2.0.html">(more)</a></span>

        <span class="date">(Aug 6, 2013)</span>
      </p>
      <p>There seems to be a common misconception among some people new to
      Haskell that programming Haskell requires you to learn category theory
      first. Nothing could be further from the truth. Category theory is a
      beautifully abstract field of mathematics, but is not at all a
      requirement when you want to learn Haskell or build serious software with
      it... <span class="read-more"><a href="./post/2013/aug/6/programming-haskell-doesnt-require-any-category-theory.html">(more)</a></span>

      </p>
      <p>Hackage, the package repository for the Haskell programming language,
      has around 5000 package nowadays. This is a lot! More libraries for a
      programming language can generally be considered a good thing.  But like
      everyone knows, package quality varies a lot and not all are easy to work
      with.  There are some general guidelines that can make a package more
      user friendly... <span class="read-more"><a href="./post/2013/may/28/towards-a-better-haskell-package.html">(more)</a></span>

      <p>Last night I gave a talk at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/funadam/">Cross Functional Amsterdam</a> user
      group. The audience was very enthusiastic and provided some thought
      provoking feedback. Thanks everyone for attending and thanks TTY for
      organizing! <span class="read-more"><a href="./post/2013/april/23/slide-cfams-talk.html">(more)</a></span>

      <p>Something I never realised before, but controlling your mouse
        pointer in the web browser is really easy. Move over the map below for

      </p>
      <p>Responsive websites are totally hip and not without reason. Sites that
      automatically adjust their layout to fit the screen size can improve
      usability a lot. With the ever growing supply of smart phones and tablets
      no assumptions can safely be made about the screen size your visitors.
      Because of its combinatoric design, building responsive sites with Clay
      is really easy. I'll quickly explain how I made this website work on
      smaller screen sizes by making use of CSS media
      queries... <span class="read-more"><a href="./post/2013/march/4/responsive-design-with-clay.html">(more)</a></span>
